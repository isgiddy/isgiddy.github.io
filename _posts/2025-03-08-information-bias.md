{% newthought 'Demographically, the human population has always been composed of 50% men and 50% women' %}. What happened to the stories of women throughout history. Women are not backseat drivers in our historical record, but have seemingly been excluded from the written world. 

This shocked me.

I ask the question what can we do to improve the situation. As an oceanographer, another typically male dominated field of science, there are women in history and contemporarily who's have gone unnamed, who recieve fewer citations than their male counterparts. Seeking measured citations when writing articles is one way of combating our societal bias. Another is to build content. This is a task I challenge myself and you.
