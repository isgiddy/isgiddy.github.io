I"ß<p>Hi,</p>

<p>I am a physical oceanographer who is curious about how winds and waves drive mixing in the ocean surface boundary layer.</p>

<p><span class="newthought">Interesting things happen at boundaries.</span>  At the air-sea interface, communication between the atmosphere and ocean takes place through turbulence. This turbulence modulates the exchange of momentum, heat, carbon, and other scalars, which in turn regulates our climate and the planets energetic balance.</p>

<p>I observe the ocean using autonomous robots that profile through the ocean or navigate the surface. I use numerical simulations to interpret these observations and learn about turbulence. We can then learn how turbulence impacts our climate and earth system but applying the turbulence theory to a number of scales in the ocean. Turbulence observations can be used together with auxillary observations, like chlorophyll or nitrate in order to understand primary production. Or using turbulence theory informed by observations to build/choose parameterizations or simple models and apply them to larger regional, climate and earth system models.</p>

<p>Science is essentially addressing hypotheses using an established method that results in robust logical reasoning in order to reach conclusions. E.g:</p>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">If P, then Q. We observe Q does not hold, not Q. Therefore not P.</code></p>

<p>This is a great method. But just doing careful, logical science is not enough. We can apply a scientific training to the broader world around us.</p>

<p><em>We donâ€™t do science in a silo.</em></p>

<p>Science is what I spend most of my time doing, but I live in society. And in society we are part of our politics. I aim to engender good scientific practices to move forward our knowledge and innovation, while acknowledging and engaging with the contemporary challenges that we all face. Such as issues relating to climate, adaptation and resilience, geopolitics and culture.</p>
