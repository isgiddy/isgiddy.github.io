I"£<p>I recently interviewed for a faculty position. It was my first interview of this style. Timing so worked out that I was 38 weeks pregnant and on zoom for the interview, which spanned over three afternoons. The first message to self is that a womens pregnant self is strong :)</p>

<p>What drove me to apply for this position? A search for independence. The freedom to be creative. A position in which I could influence the powers that be. Whether this is a percieved ideal or reality I am not sure yet.</p>

<p>I thought I would jot down a few reflections here. Some questions I was posed that I would like to reflect on further:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What does success mean to you?</li>
  <li>When you retire and look back at your professional self what would your today self want to see?</li>
  <li>What do you admire in a mentor?</li>
  <li>What leadership qualities do you value?</li>
  <li>Why do you do what you do?</li>
</ol>
