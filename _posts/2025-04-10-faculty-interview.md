I recently interviewed for a faculty position. It was my first interview of this style. Timing so worked out that I was 38 weeks pregnant. I got myself dressed up (mental power), went to university and spent three afternoons on zoom. The first message to self is that a womens pregnant self is strong :) 

What drove me to apply for this position? A search for independence. The freedom to be creative. The potential to lead and create a scientific research group. The challenge. A position in which I could influence the powers that be. Whether this is a percieved ideal or reality I am not sure yet. 

The whole process seemed to be a mix of the search committee trying to get to know me, know why I was applying to that particular university, what I would do, my teaching interests and philosophy, my approach to work. The actual work/research seemed less important. 

I thought I would jot down a few reflections here of some questions I was posed that I would like to reflect on further:

*What does success mean to you?*   
Happiness! 
Professionally successful? Anyone (given the right training and resources) can be a good scientist and do good science. This is not my definition of success. Perhaps success is where one can draw a link between science, policy and people. Acheiving good science while being present and engaged with your community (this can be local scientific community, longterm scientific relations across the world, the community outside of academia...now thats politics).

*When you retire and look back at your professional self what would your today self want to see?*  
This one is still pending.   

*What do you admire in a mentor?*     
Someone who listens, does not impose and is self-critical. 

*What leadership qualities do you value?*   
A leader who can bring others to be their true selves is something I really admire. Creating the space for expression and critical thinking.  

*Why do you do what you do?*   
I am curious. I am good at it, so it is rewarding. I value deeply the freedom of thought.   

For others out there going to do their first this-type interview, I got some good advice that I'll share here. They center around two points. You. Think about your narrative. How your past informs your future. What are the big questions you want to address. What you can change and improve in the place where you are applying. And the implementation. I.e. The funding plan. I think the main focus, after doing the interview is really the *you* part. 

What was most challenging? I think the performance. Being professional while being genuine. 

What was most rewarding? Being seen. Putting time in to reflect on my path to this point and imagine what I would do with such an opportunity.
